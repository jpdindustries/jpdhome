## Overview

This is the static homepage for jpd.industries, featuring a high-performance WebGL implementation using Three.js. The website creates an immersive space scene with GPU-accelerated rendering, multi-layered parallax systems, procedurally generated starfields, and dynamic nebula effects that respond to user input.

## Features

### Parallax System
- **Desktop**: Mouse movement creates a parallax effect.
- **Mobile**: Uses the device gyroscope for motion control.
- **Depth Effect**: Layers move at different speeds to create a sense of depth.

### Starfield
- ~1000 procedurally generated stars.
- Various star types and colors.
- Effects include:
  - Pulsing red giants
  - Twinkling stars
  - Shining stars
  - Shooting stars

### Visuals
- Drifting red and purple nebula clouds.
- Floating objects: astronaut, meteorite, rocket, and satellite.
- The centered logo has a pulsing glow that reacts to user input.
